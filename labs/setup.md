# Setup Student VM's

### Launch VS Code in Administrator Mode to Install software in a Terminal window

### Step 1: Run VS Code as Administrator
1. Close any open instances of Visual Studio Code.
2. Search for "Visual Studio Code" in the Start menu.
3. Right-click on it and select **Run as Administrator**.
   - If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click **Yes** to allow it.

### **Step 2: Open the Integrated Terminal**
1. In VS Code, click on the **Terminal** menu at the top and select **New Terminal**.
   - Alternatively, use the shortcut: `Ctrl + ~` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ~` (Mac).
2. Ensure the terminal is using **PowerShell**, as Chocolatey requires it.

### **Step 3: Set Execution Policy**
1. Check the current execution policy by running:
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```
2. If the policy is not `AllSigned` or `Bypass`, set it to `Bypass` temporarily:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
   ```

## Install Chocolatey

### **Step 4: Install Chocolatey**
1. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```
2. Wait for the script to complete. Chocolatey will be installed on your system.

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Installation**
1. Test that Chocolatey is installed by running:
   ```powershell
   choco --version
   ```
   - This should display the installed version of Chocolatey.

---

### **Step 6: Test Chocolatey with a Package Installation**
1. Try installing a test package to confirm everything is working:
   ```powershell
   choco install git -y
   ```
2. After installation, restart VS Code as Administrator and confirm that the package works (e.g., `git --version`).

---

### **Important Note:**
Always remember to run VS Code in **Administrator mode** whenever you need to use Chocolatey for installing or managing software that requires system-level changes.

### **Step 7: Install wget**

``` bash
choco install wget -y
```
### **Step 8: Install AWSCLI**

``` bash
choco install awscli -y
```
